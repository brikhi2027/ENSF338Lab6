# 1. Write a class named which uses a Python array as a storage backend for heap nodes
class Heap:
    def __init__(self, array):
        self._array = array

        def heapify(self, array):
        # receives as input an array of integers, stores into the internal array, and turn it into a heap

        def enqueue():
        # adds an element to the heap (while correctly maintaining the heap's properties)

        def dequeue():
        # removes an element from the heap (while correctly maintaining the heap's properties)
            


# 2. Write 3 tests for the following cases: [0.1 pts]
#   • Input array is already a correctly sorted heap
#   • Input array is empty
#   • Input array is a long, randomly shuffled list of integers
# Each test must consist of running the code on an appropriate input, and comparing the
# output (heapified array) with the expected value.
